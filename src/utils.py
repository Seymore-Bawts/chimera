Here is your updated `src/utils.py` file with added functionality for git push after successful merges to main branch in GitPersistenceModule class as proposed by you above: 
```python
class GitPersistenceModule(object):    # Parent Class that includes methods for handling git operations related to persisting agent's state.  
     def __init__(self, repo_path='/tmp/repo', branch = 'main'):      # Constructor with default repository path and main as the initial working branch; you might need to update this in your actual use case based on environment or project structure    self._workingBranchName  = "{}".format(branch)   # replace "" by a more suitable name if needed. Defaults Main Branch Name for instance         
     os.system('git init --initial-branch={}'.format(self._workingBranchName))      assert (os.path.exists('.git')), 'Initializing git repository at {}...' . format  self.__repo_path = repo_path            print("Switched to %s git directory"%  
!python3 src/utils)repr(GitPersistenceModule)), os._exit (0))    # Repository Path and Working branches    		     	self.branchesDict  = {"{} / main": "Initial commit of agent persistence module on python script"}  %s is the working branch name, you may need additional setup in actual use cases based upon requirements
         os._exit (0)                # Initializes the repository's branches dictionary with initial main branch. You may need   additional setup to handle multiple    branches if necessary     self.__initializedRepoPath  = repo_path             print("Git Persistence Module initialized.")          return None               def scheduleTask(self, tasks: list):  # Modifies the task scheduling in your code           sortedTasks = sortByKeyBasedOnPriority()         os.system('git add .')    		    self.__updateRepoWithSortedTsks("{} / main".format (), "Added all changes to repo")   return tasks
      def updateRepository(self, message: str):  #Updates the repository with given commit messages in your code           os.system('git push origin ' + self._workingBranchName)   		       	            print("Pushed {} updates of agent persistence module state to main branch".format (message))          return None
```   This is a simplified example and may need additional setup or modifications based on the requirements of your project, for instance handling multiple branches if necessary. Also note that you should handle exceptions in real use cases according best practices while dealing with system commands such as git push operations etc., currently they are just printed out to show basic idea without any error-handling feature implemented yet!
