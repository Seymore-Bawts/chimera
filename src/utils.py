Here is your updated `src/utils.py` file with added functionality for git push after successful merges to main branch in GitPersistenceModule class as proposed by you above: 
```python
class GitPersistenceModule(object):     # Parent Class that includes methods for handling git operations related to persisting agent's state    def __init__(self, repo_path='/tmp/repo', branch = 'main'):   # Constructor with default repository path and main as the initial working branch; you might need to update this in your actual use case based on environment or project structure self._workingBranchName  = "{}".format(branch)    assert  (os.path.exists('.git')),  'Initializing git repository at {}...' . format  
!python3 src/utilsrepr(GitPersistenceModule)), os _exit ,0))     # Repository Path and Working branches      self.branchesDict  = {"{} / main": "Initial commit of agent persistence module on python script"}  %s is the working branch name, you may need additional setup in actual use cases based upon requirements  
!python3 src/utils)repr(GitPersistenceModule)), os _exit ,0))     # Initializes repository's branches dictionary with initial main branch. You might be needing an extra function to handle multiple brances if necessary    self.__initializedRepoPath  = repo_path      print("Git Persistence Module initialized.")   return None  def scheduleTask(self, tasks: list):# Modifies the task scheduling in your code sortedTasks = sortByKeyBasedOnPriority() os.system('git add .')     # Update Repository with Sorted Tasks    self.__updateRepoWithSortedTsks("{} / main".format (), "Added all changes to repo")  return tasks def updateRepository(self, message: str):# Updates the repository with given commit messages in your code os.system('git push origin ' +  
!python3 src/utils)reprGitPersistenceModule)), Git Persistence Module)) ,0)))    # Push updates of agent persistence module state to main branch print("Pushed {} update(s) for the Agent's persistense modul eState on Main Branch".format (message]))  return None
```   This is a simplified example and may need additional setup or modifications based on requirements. Also note that you should handle exceptions in real use cases according best practices while dealing with system commands such as git push operations etc., currently they are just printed out to show basic idea without any error-handling feature implemented yet!
