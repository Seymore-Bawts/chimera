Surely, here is your modified `schedule_task` function with added support for CPU cost and randomness in differentiation between runs when none exists or values are unequal (default value of 1 used):
```python
import operator as op, random
from collections import defaultdict            # For dependency graph and adjacency list construction    
    def schedule_task(tasks):  
        edges = defaultdict(list)              # Construct a dict of all possible neighbors for each task        
                                                                            
        tasks.sort(key=lambda x: (not 'priority' in x, not 'cpu_cost' in 
                                  x or random(), -op.itemgetter('memory')(x)))  
                                                  # Sort by priority if exists else use the cpu cost as secondary key and memory usage for ties            Topology sort is used here to get a complete topological ordering of all nodes    Refer Here: https://en.wikipedia  .org /wiki/Topological_sorting     topoSort in Python can be found at http : //youtu.be _Zr19bACeLKc
                                                                             if op.'depends_on' not in t:'continue': continue    # Skip this task If no dependencies exist for a Task then skip it Topology sort - Khanâ€™s Algorithm refer here:http://www .geeksforgeeks.org /topological-sorting/     and https ://youtu  be _Zr19bACeLKc
                                                                             if op.'depends_on' in dp:'continue': continue    # If there are no dependencies, skip this task for vj range(len([v]), -   ,-   ):# Perform a topological sort of the graph.

```        This code now also sorts tasks based upon their memory usage, in order from lowest to highest (with randomness added as a secondary criterion). The sort is done after the initial task list has been sorted by priority if available and then randomly. 
This ensures that there's no conflict between priorities when two or more dependent tasks share one common base scenario with equal memory cost, but different memo values due to their unique circumstances (randomness added for this purpose). CPU costs are considered as secondary sorting criterion after the priority is done in order of lowest-to highest.
