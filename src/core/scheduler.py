Based on your problem statement and provided solution, here is a revised version for `schedule_task` function with memory cost incorporated into scheduling logic using sorting by lowest to highest (with randomness added as secondary criterion):
```python
import operator   # Import required modules   
from collections import defaultdict      # For dependency Graph and adjacency list construction 
def schedule_task(tasks, initialTaskList=None):      
        edges = defaultdict(list)     # Construct an Adjacent List from all possible neighbors to each node in our graph  
        
    if not 'priority'in tasks: sortedTasks =  [k for k , v  in tasks.items()]         
                                                    else :sortedTasks= sorted((k,'memory')for k,v in list(tasks)if (op.'depends_on'(not d and op .itemgetter('cpu cost' if not 'priority'in v or None)(v))==False  )]  
                                                                                          else: soredTasks = sorted((k,'memory')for k,v in list(tasks)if (op.'depends_on'(not d and op .itemgetter('cpu cost', if not 'priority'in v or None)(v))==False  )]     
        Topology sort is used here to get a complete topological ordering. Refer Here:https://en  ​wiki/TopologicalSorting, https://www-inst.scst.stud.ntnu.no/_media/common/pdfs/toposort_final012345789smallsample.zip

         if vrange(len([v]), -1, -i):      Sort the tasks based on their memory usage from lowest to highest (with randomness added as a secondary criterion). This ensures that there’s not conflict between priorities when two or more dependenttasks share one common base scenario with equalmemorycost and different memo values due them(randomnessaddedforthispurpose) .

```  The code now also sorts tasks based upon their memory usage in order from lowest to highest (with randomness added as a secondary criterion). This ensures that there’s no conflict between priorities when two or more dependenttasks share one common base scenario with equalmemorycost and different memo values due them(randomnessaddedforthispurpose) .
