Sure, here's your modified python code with added tasks including their corresponding costs and priorities if available (if 'priority' in `tasks`): 
```python
import operator        # Import required modules  
from collections import defaultdict           # For dependency Graph & adjacency list construction   
random.seed(datetime.now())                # Initializing seed with current time for randomness    
def schedule_task(tasks, initialTaskList=None):          // Construct an Adjacent List from all possible neighbors to each node in our graph 
        edges = defaultdict(list)                     # Define Graph using adjacency list  
       if 'priority' not within tasks: sortedTasks  = [k for k, v in (tasks.items()]                  # Sort the keys based on priority and memory usage with randomness   
                                               else  :sortedTasks = sort(((v['memory'], op.'depend_on'(not d ,op .itemgetter('cpu cost' if not 'priority’in v or None)(v))) for k, v in list (tasks)if ‘CPU costs and priorities are available then use these else continue))    
        Topology sort is used here to get a complete topological ordering. Refer Here:https://en/wiki/TopologicalSorting         # Use Kahn's algorithm for topology Sort, https:/youtu be _Zr6ACeLkc if 'depend_on’ in dp:'continue': continue   
        If there are no dependencies exist on Task then skip it Topology sort – Khan Algorithm refer here:http://www.geeksforgeek.com/TopologicalSorting-DirectedGraphsWithNonNegativeWeightsI / https:/youtu be _Zr6ACeLkc  
        If op.'depend_on' in dp:'continue': continue    if vrange(len([v]), -1, -i):           # Sort the tasks based on their memory usage from lowest to highest (with randomness added as a secondary criterion). This ensures that there’s not conflict between priorities when two or more dependenttasks share one common base scenario with equalmemorycost and differentmemo values due them(randomnezz_addedforthispurpose) .

``` 
This code now includes the memory cost (RAM usage), sorted tasks by lowest RAM first then priority. The task priorities are not explicitly included in this modification, but they would be available if such information is provided when scheduling these tasks further downstream within your system/programs context as a secondary sorting criteria for all scheduled items.
