Here's a complete pytest unit test example to verify your new `schedule_task` function with multiple edge cases and dependencies included in it, as well topological sort logic is correct if no cpuCost present (None) for tasks that have None values removed from the priorities list. 
```python
import random
from src.core import scheduler # assuming your core module has a source file named 'scheduler' which contains schedule_task function and other necessary components to run tests properly.

def test_schedule_cpuCostless():    
    tasks = [{"id": i, "priority" : random.randint(10,-5),  } for i in range (26)] #creates a list of dictionaries with unique ids and no cpu cost present or given  
                                                                                   #for example purposes only to demonstrate the functionality correctly   
     assert scheduler.schedule_task(tasks) == sorted([v['id']] for v in tasks if not 'cpuCost'  in v), \       "Error: Tests should pass when no cpu cost is present or given."   #This line of code will fail the test and print a message indicating that tests are passing.
                                                                           
def test_schedule_priorityCos():    
    tasks = [{"id": i,  'cpuCost' : random.randint(0,-5), "priority" :random.choice([1 ,2]) } for i in range (4)] #creates a list of dictionaries with unique ids and no priority present or given  
                                                                                   #for example purposes only to demonstrate the functionality correctly   
     assert scheduler.schedule_task(tasks) == sorted((v['id']  if 'cpuCost' not in v else None for v in tasks), key=lambda x: (x['priority'], random.randint(-5,4)) ), \       "Error: Tests should pass when no priority is present or given."   #This line of code will fail the test and print a message indicating that tests are passing
 
def test_schedule_cpuCostlessPriority():    
    tasks = [{"id": i , 'priority' : random.randint(10, -5), "cpuCost" :random.choice([2,-3])} for i in range (7)] #creates a list of dictionaries with unique ids and no cpu cost present or given  
                                                                                   #for example purposes only to demonstrate the functionality correctly   
     assert scheduler.schedule_task(tasks) == sorted((v['id'] if 'cpuCost' not in v else None for  v in tasks), key=lambda x: (x ['priority'], random.randint (-5,4)) ), \       "Error : Tests should pass when no cpu cost is present or given."   #This line of code will fail the test and print a message indicating that tests are passing
 
def test_schedule_allNone():    
    tasks = [{"id": i} for i in range (6)]                                                                        #Creates list with no priorities nor cpu cost present or given. Example purposes only to demonstrate functionality correctly  
      assert scheduler.schedule_task(tasks) == sorted((v['id'] if 'cpuCost' not  in v else None for v in tasks), key=lambda x: (x ['priority'], random.randint (-5,4)) ), \       "Error : Tests should pass when no priority or cpu cost is present."   #This line of code will fail the test and print a message indicating that tests are passing
```  This pytest unit testing framework ensures you're thoroughly checking all possible edge cases with your function. The assert statement inside each 'if condition', allows us to check for expected results, in this case if no priority or cpu cost is present it should fail as per our requirement and print a message indicating so on failure of the test Case .
