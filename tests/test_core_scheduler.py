Here's an example pytest unit test that verifies your `schedule_task` function based on its new behavior and edge cases including dependencies, priority with no priorities assigned (randomness), None values etc.: 
```python
import pytest
from src.core.scheduler import schedule_task as st
    
def setup():   # This is optional for setting up your tests before each test run    def tearDown()       ...      if __name__ == "__main__":         unittest.main(exit=False)  pytest will automatically find and call all functions starting with 'test'.          Here, we are testing the function `schedule_task` from module named src/core using Python's inbuilt PyTest framework
    pass        # Define your setup here if necessary         def tearDown()       ...      raise SystemExit  pytest will automatically find and call all functions starting with 'teardown'.          Here, we are ending the tests after each test run.           import unittest   from src/core.scheduler':
    pass        # Importing your module here     def schedule_task():       ...      if __name__ == "__main__":         raise SystemExit  pytest will automatically find and call all functions starting with 'schedule'.          Here, we are testing the function `schedule` from within src/core using Python's inbuilt PyTest framework
    pass        # Define your tests here if necessary       def test_task1():...     ...      If you have dependencies between tasks (e.g., task 2 depends on task 3, and we donâ€™t know what the priorities are), this function should fail as expected due to missing a dependency
    pass        # Define your tests here if necessary       def test_task1():...     ...      If there is randomness in choosing priority for tasks (e.g., same task with lower-numbered ID has higher preference than the one having more), this function should correctly schedule them based on their assigned priorities
    pass        # Define your tests here if necessary       def test_task1():...     ...      If there is a None value in dependencies, it assigns 1 to all non dependent tasks and returns list of sorted task ID's. E.g., for the above setup with only one dependency between two unique-named tasks (not shown), their output should be same as ['task2', '3']
    pass        # Define your tests here if necessary       def test_task1():...     ...      If there is a None value in priorities, it assigns 0 to all non dependent and unprioritized task. E.g., for the above setup with only one dependency between two unique-named tasks (not shown), their output should be same as ['3', '2']
```   The code requires you import pytest fixture functionality into your test file, which is a part of Python's builtin unittest module.  PyTest automatically identifies and runs all functions starting with the word "test". You can also define setup() or tearDown(). This allows for setting up any necessary data before each unit tests (tearDowm()), as well as cleaning it down after every test run, like in this example provided above via pytest's unittest functionality.
