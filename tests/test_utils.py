Sure! Here's a simple pytest unit test to verify your `updateRepository` method in our GitPersistenceModule class from utils module, using mocking and fixture setup methods provided by PyTest (fixtures are run once per session). 
Please note that this is just an example. You might need additional implementation or configuration according with the requirements of your project:
```python
import pytest
from src import GitPersistenceModule   # Assume you have a module named 'src' in current directory which includes class `GitPersistenceModule` and methods for testing such as scheduleTask, updateRepository. 
pytest.fixture() def persister():    return GitPersistenceModule(repo_path='/tmp/persist', branch = "main")   # This fixtures creates a new instance of the class with some parameters set by default in `src` module for testing purposes    
                                                      @pytest.mark.parametrize("tasks", [[1,2],[3]])  def test_scheduleTask(persister):    persister = pytest.fixture_scope('function')   # Use a function scope to ensure the fixtures are run for each individual tests    
                                                                                                          assert isinstance (persister.scheduleTasks([1,2], [3]), list)  Assert not None or False if exceptions raised in your methods    def test__updateRepoWithSortedTsks(self):   # Assumes `src` module also has a method named 'test_updateRepository' with the same signature. You should run these tests on corresponding parts of code which implement this functionality    
                                                                                                      assert isinstance (persister.__updaterepowithsorteds("path", "message"), None)  Assert not None or False if exceptions raised in your methods    def test__init__(self):   # Assumes `src` module has an init method with the same signature. You should run these tests on corresponding parts of code which implement this functionality    
                                                                                                      assert isinstance (persister.__initializedRepoPath, str)  Assert not None or False if exceptions raised in your methods    def test_updateRepository(self):   # Assumes `src` module has a method named 'testUpdate' with the same signature. You should run these tests on corresponding parts of code which implement this functionality    
                                                                                                      assert isinstance (persister.__repoPath, str)  Assert not None or False if exceptions raised in your methods    def test_scheduleTask(self):   # Assumes `src` module has a method named 'testSchedule' with the same signature. You should run these tests on corresponding parts of code which implement this functionality
```     This is just an example, you may need to modify or add more cases according your actual project requirements and test scenario as well such sorting by priority tasks in scheduling process etc..  If there are dependencies within classes (as we assume it here), then the topological order logic will be implemented. IMPORTANT: ONLY output raw Python code for this unit tests file, do not include explanations or markdown formatting!
