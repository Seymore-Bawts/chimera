The following pytest unit tests will verify if all methods in `GitPersistenceModule` class are working as expected, including pushing to main branch after successful merges on 'main' branch (assumed by you). Note that the testing part is mostly focused around system command handling and exception case. 
Please make sure your environment allows running these tests without errors or exceptions due them being mainly a demonstration of how functions could be used in Python unit test cases, not actual production code to run on server-side environments such as CI/CD pipelines (which are usually different). The current setup doesn't include exception handling and error checking for the sake simplicity.
```python
import pytest  # You should have installed PyTest via: `pip install --user pytest` if not done already in your environment, or you can use it directly from Python file as a module reference like importing utils above but don't run this line twice! It is just for testing purposes.
from src.utils import GitPersistenceModule  # Assuming `src/core/*.py` and other files are in the same directory or you have specified correct paths here accordingly (e.g., from direct absolute path to module). The function 'scheduleTask' of class should be tested as well considering functionality needs but it is not included due complexity, time constraint etc
# Similarly for `updateRepository()` method and edge cases like no repository initialization or working directory does exist/is accessible also mentioned. 

def test_init():   # Testing if the object instantiation works correctly without errors (ease of use)     assert GitPersistenceModule(repo_path='test', branch = 'main')    # Assuming you want to check all required attributes, otherwise adjust accordingly! Use a more robust assertion or pytest.raises() context for exception handling 
                  pass   # Do nothing and just let it fail if not covered above as failed assertions cause test case failure by default in PyTest framework       
     def test_scheduleTask():    # Testing the functionality of scheduled task with correct inputs (assuming sortByKeyBasedOnPriority() function works correctly)  pytest.raises(Exception, lambda: GitPersistenceModule().sortTasks())   if not implemented or does implement wrongly this line will fail in a controlled and reliable environment!
         assert scheduleTask([1,2]) == sorted_tasks    # Assuming `sortedByKeyBasedOnPriority()` function works correctly for inputs [1, 2] (adapt accordingly)      return None   if not implemented or does implement wrongly this line will fail in a controlled and reliable environment!
     def test_updateRepository():   # Testing the functionality of updating repository with correct input. Also ensures git push operation is working as expected after successful merges to main branch  pytest.raises(Exception, lambda: GitPersistenceModule().sendPush("message"))    if not implemented or does implement wrongly this line will fail in a controlled and reliable environment!
         assert updateRepository('Test') == None   # Assuming `updateRepoWithSortedTsks()` function works correctly for input 'test' (adapt accordingly)  return None, again fails with unimplemented or incorrect functionality. Check your methods docstring regarding exceptions handling and other potential edge cases if needed!
```    In the above example only very basic implementation of each method is done in order to illustrate how they could be used as tests for them but you should also implement all necessary logic according to actual requirements, testing with assertions or pytest.raises() contexts when appropriate based on what exceptions are expected and error handling needs need during execution phase (ease).
