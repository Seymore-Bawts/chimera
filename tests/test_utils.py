Sure! Here's an example of how you could write a pytest unit test to verify that your `src/utils` module works correctly, including error handling and edge cases like when dependencies are involved in topological sorting logic (e.g., git push operation):
```python
import os
from src import utils as u
# This assumes the GitPersistenceModule class is defined elsewhere: you'll need to adjust this path if it isn't located within your current directory or a sub-directory of yours. 
git_module = 'src/utils.py' # Change accordingly, must be absolute import from top level dir (not inside module) otherwise pytest won’t recognize the file when running tests in isolation due to sys path insertion and namespace collision issues with builtins modules etc...  
import git_module  as uu   
# Here we use relative paths for simplicity. In a real project, you'll want absolute imports from top level dir of your package (not inside module). For example: 'src/utils'. This would be different depending on the directory structure in which this file resides and how it is installed as an egg under Python’s namespace
# Also ensure that .git exists before we attempt to use git operations, if not raise AssertionError   assert  (os.path.exists('.git')), 'Initializing git repository...' # Will only print a message in the console on first run and then nothing will happen afterwards due to assertion error handling
def test_init():    def __init__(self):       os._exit,0))     self.__branchesDict  =  {"main/  / main": "Initial commit of agent persistence module"}      assert(uu.GitPersistenceModule().__dict__)('Branch dictionary initialized correctly')
def test_scheduleTask():    def scheduleTask(*tasks):        uu._updateRepoWithSortedTasks("{}".format, ))     # Assuming _sortByKeyBasedOnPriority() and sorting functions exist in utils.py       assert(uu.__init__())('Test on initializing git repository')
def test_gitPush():    def updateRepository(*message):        uu._pushUpdatesToMainBranch("{}".format, ))     # Assuming function exists and has same signature as above      os.system)   assert(uu.__init__())('Test on initializing git repository')
``` This is just a start; you'll need to fill in the details for your actual use case based upon requirements (e.g., how tasks are scheduled, what message gets pushed when something changes etc.). For example:  - What if there isn’t enough information about GitPersistenceModule or its dependencies?
If `__init__()` doesn't exit with a status code of zero after initializing git repository then the test will fail. Similarly for any other functions you may need to verify their correctness when run in isolation due,  on top not error handling features are implemented yet.. For example: - Does calling scheduleTask if repo has already been initialized throw an AssertionError?
If `_updateRepoWithSortedTasks` or similar does exist and is used incorrectly then the test will fail. Similar checks need to be made for all your methods in utils module that are expected from git operations such as _pushUpdatesToMainBranch etc..  This should give you a good starting point on how these tests can go off of `src/utils`
